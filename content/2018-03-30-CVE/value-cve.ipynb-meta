Description: A Canadian oil company that got bashed over its acquisition of assets from ConocoPhilips in May 17, 2017. The asset was worth almost $18b while the entire company was worth $15b. Shareholders were enraged over the fact that a part of the deal were purchased by issuing common stocks (thereby diluting shareholder shares in the process). They were also worried about the amount of debt they used to finance this purchase.

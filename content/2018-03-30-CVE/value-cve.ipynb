    "> 2017 was a year of significant change for Cenovus, where we gained full ownership of our oil sands assets,\n",
    "acquired an additional core operating area in the Deep Basin and divested the majority of our legacy Conventional\n",
    "assets. On May 17, 2017, we acquired from ConocoPhillips Company and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively,\n",
    "“ConocoPhillips”) their 50 percent interest in the FCCL Partnership (“FCCL”), and the majority of ConocoPhillips’\n",
    "western Canadian conventional assets in the Deep Basin in Alberta and British Columbia for total consideration of $17.9 billion (“the Acquisition”).\n",

    "Clearwater areas of the Deep Basin, representing approximately 15,000 BOE per day of production, to further\n",
    "streamline our portfolio and deleverage our balance sheet.\n",

    "Change of strategy, focusing on core business.\n",

    "\n",
    "This sentence may be cross-checked with the news articles above.\n",

    "> Over the last few months, Cenovus has made considerable progress in reducing debt and is taking steps to right-size the Company for the current environment.

    "\n",
    "[Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/Whats-going-to-happen-when-all-the-oil-runs-out) by Berkeley professor Richard A Muller (positive. We will stick with oil for some good years ahead):\n",
    "\n",
    "> The advantages of gasoline are so great, that I predict we will stick with it for mobile transportation. We will cut its CO2 emissions in half, maybe by ⅔, by more efficient automobiles. We will attack CO2 emissions primarily in industry and electric power generation by severely reducing the use of coal. Coal will be replaced by energy conservation (“megawatts”), shale gas, and nuclear power. Solar and wind will contribute, but not as much as many people would like, because their expense will remain too high for most of the developing world. I expect that the major use of coal will eventually become the manufacture of gasoline. Yes, it will still contribute to global warming, but at a pace that is much reduced.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> I am not advocating this future. I am simply trying to evaluate objectively the direction that I see an economically-driven world moving. Most of the world will use oil because of its low expense and convenience. The pace of global warming will slow as we use fossil fuels more efficiently and build nuclear capability, and most of the developing countries will decide that adaptation to increased warmth is a better option than expensive and inconvenient energy.\n",

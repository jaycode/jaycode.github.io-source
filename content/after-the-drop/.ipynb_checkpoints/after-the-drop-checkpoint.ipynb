    "# What Comes After a Period of Undervaluation?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "In his now venerated book *Security Analysis (1934)*, Benjamin Graham preached the importance of buying undervaluated stocks i.e. stocks of higher intrinsic values than their current market value. In this experiment, I collected 5 stocks with the largest drops in one year and then analyzed their price movements in the coming year, their quantitative, and qualitative characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview ot the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The date of experiment is 2017-06-16. Data were ordered by their largest drop in price and filtered to pass in only rows with Graham's recommended Price-to-Earnings ratio between 0.0 and 15.0. For an added safety measure, I also threw in Liquidation Value > 0.0, using the optimistic liquidation rate (page 560, Security Analysis sixth edition, Graham-Dodd). I also took out companies from utilities, mining, and oil industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Please read the [accompanying Appendixes page](https://teguhwijaya.com/after-the-drop-appendixes) for income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Results as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![data](data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### PLV\n",
    "\n",
    "Price-to-Liquidation Value. Graham recommended to find undervaluated stocks with liquidation value higher than market valuation of the company. In other words, PLV between 0 and 1. I was not able to find any such thing, except for Chinese-originated companies structured under VIE (Variable Interest Entity) which turned to be fraudulent operations - a material for another article.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LV\n",
    "\n",
    "Liquidation Value. A company's liquidation assets minus all liabilities. To calculate liquidation assets, we discount tangible assets by some percentage to account for the rushed assets sales during receivership.\n",
    "\n",
    "### WCR\n",
    "\n",
    "Working Capital Ratio. A ratio of working capital (current assets) to current liabilities. The customary recommended value is 2-to-1. Graham also recommended performing a kind of acid test by ensuring current assets minus inventories are at least equal to current liabilities (page 592, Security Analysis sixth edition, Graham-Dodd).\n",
    "\n",
    "### PB\n",
    "\n",
    "Price-to-Book ratio. Since PLV is a stricter requirement, this value may not be needed anymore, but I included it as this is a more popular measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PE\n",
    "\n",
    "Price-to-Earnings ratio. A ratio between 0 and 15 usually signals an undervaluation, unless if the company has a potential for larger future earnings. Keep in mind, however, hoping for a larger future earnings is essentially speculative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PE diff\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between the stock's and industry's PE ratios. I added this factor to see how the stock's price discount compares to other stocks' in the same industry. An industry is a smaller group than a sector, I chose to use it instead of the latter to allow for more apple-to-apple comparison (i.e. I shall prefer to compare one gold mining company to another rather than with, say, a coal mining company).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, let us confirm the information available to investors during that time:\n",
    "\n",

    "Our companies' Dilluted Earnings per Share are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![eps](eps.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some interesting findings so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ACIA recent IPO\n",
    "\n",
    "ACIA had no earnings prior to 2016 Q1. Looking at Morningstar, their IPO was fairly recent, with the first annual report entry was in 2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cyclical Earnings in Apparel industry\n",
    "\n",
    "Apparel industry has a cycle in earnings, as evident in the foregoing table that the fourth quarter earnings were usually more than other quarters. This, however, runs into contrary in the CATO's case, for which the first quarters had more earnings compared to others. A deeper dive into its quarterly and annual reports should tell us more about this pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the existence of the business cycle explained in the foregoing discussion, earnings comparisons need to be made in quarter pairs. All of the Apparel companies had worse 2017 Q1 earnings compared to their 2016 Q1 earnings, and this does seem to be the point of interest in their quarterly reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declines Not Caused Solely by Quarterly Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it does not seem that the decline in prices were in response to this quarter's earnings report. The down trend had started prior to that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prices Tend To Balance Themselves Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Stock prices of undervalued stocks do tend to balance itself. In the case Urban Outfitters Inc, it even went up to a new high. What separates this company from the rest of the pack? *Todo: This finding is only true for this small 5-stocks case, so it is not by any mean conclusive. There are some quantitative methods to find but it is a material for another article.*"

    "## Balance Sheet Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis in this section gives a foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "### ACIA\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the Overview section, a company with well-financed operations has a working capital to liabilities ratio of 2.0. In the case of ACIA, the high ratio may indicate either a financial strength or an inefficient use of working capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of ACIA, current assets are composed of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cash and cash equivalents: 140\n",
    "- Short term investments: 132\n",
    "- Receivables: 115\n",
    "- Inventories: 34\n",
    "- Prepaid expenses: 18\n",
    "- **Total: 438**\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of receivables is quite dangerously substantial. A peek into its Quarterly Report is essential to find out the company's capability to collect this debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting item in this exhibit is its annual Stockholders' equity growth that goes as follows for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016: -39, -29, 8, 435 (all in millions). Notice the huge jump in 2016. This was due to the increase in \"Cash and cash equivalents\" (+178) and \"Short-term investments\" (+104). By looking at the Cash Flow Statements, we may see an increase of net income from 41 to 132 (+91) and Common stock issuance, repurchase and other financing activities that amounts for an additional 199 in cash. In conclusion, 2016 was an extremely good year for ACIA, and then with the cash from its additional earnings and common stock issuance, the company made an investment (or a series of investments) totalling 121 millions. All these facts need to be cross-checked further by reading their 2016 Annual Report.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Epilogue\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen from the price performance and earnings post 2017-06-16, the investment did not seem to turn into a success. It would be interesting to read through their reports as a further study to find a) what went wrong, and b) if the investment would eventually turn to be a success in the future; the price had been rallied up since 2018-04-20, the possibility is there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXPR\n",
    "\n",
    "Stockholders' equity has shown a prosperous growth year by year. In fact, it grew 1.7 times in five years (636 millions in 2017-1 from 371 millions in 2013-1), that was amazing. Working capital ratio and liquidation value were both good, as shown in the \"Overview of the Dataset\" section above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Epilogue\n",
    "\n",
    "This was indeed an amazing company to invest in. The stock price shot up almost twice the current price in December 2017. By December 6, at the stock price of 11.05, Express Inc published their 2017 Q3 Report, from where we may see a PE of 137.5 (11.05 / 0.08), which would have been a very strong signal to sell, resulting in a 163% profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is quite unlikely that we would have kept the shares until the end of 2017. 2017 Q2 was marked with a drop in both earnings and revenue, causing a loss of 5 million, followed by another loss of 12 million in Q3. It would have been a great test of will to keep them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stated oppositely, however, a sharp rally of a stock price could be very well marked by a turning point from negative to positive earnings. *Todo: This is a pattern that needs to be confirmed quantitatively via a statistical method.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### URBN\n",
    "\n",
    "URBN and CATO use an alternative accounting method for Property, Plant, and Equipment (ppe) where they recalculate non-current assets annually instead of per-quarter. Either way does not have any effect to our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The growth of URBN's stockholders' equity was not as spectacular as EXPR. Stockholders' equity grew from 1.355 billions in 2013-1 to 1.694 billions in 2014-1, and then shrunk to 1.313 billions in 2017-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Epilogue\n",
    "\n",
    "URBN stock price had since gradually increased to 45.73 in 2018-6-16, marking more than 151% increase from 2017-6-16. The performance had a lower volatility compared to the other stocks we analyzed. I think this is a perfect stock to keep for a value investor. EXPR had a higher and faster return, but it was hard to decide the optimal selling point as explained in the foregoing discussion."

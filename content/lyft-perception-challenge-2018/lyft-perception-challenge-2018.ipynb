    "## 2. Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I will describe some preprocessing steps that were done in this project. All data were gathered by recording images from CARLA simulation on 800 x 600 pixels resolution. In addition to 1000 images provided by Lyft, I recorded 72 more runs, each contains 274 screenshots. Total images is then `1000 + (72 * 274) = 20728` images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Initial preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "These images are resized into 256 x 256 pixels to accommodate the model's input. Segmentation data are processed to only take the road and cars, convert everything else to background (including our car's hood), and reindex the segmentation (0 for background, 1 for road, and 2 for cars). Below are some examples of the training data:\n",
    "\n",
    "![data1](./data1.png)\n",
    "![data2](./data2.png)\n",
    "![data3](./data3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Data Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "I augmented the data by running three operations at random to the training data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Horizontal flip\n",
    "2. Brightness with gamma between 0.4 to 3.0\n",
    "3. Rotation between -5.0 to +5.0 degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the images on both extremes:\n",
    "\n",
    "![aug1](./aug1.png)\n",
    "![aug2](./aug2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Brightness randomization is not straightforward since there is a different range between 0.4 to 1.0 (dimmer) and 1.0 to 3.0 (lighter). I initially randomized (with 50% probability) of either dimmer or lighter, then took a value from a uniform distribution from either range. The following graph illustrates the result distribution from 1000 random picks:\n",
    "\n",
    "![gamma](./gamma.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Training Configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "The training was set up to run for 54 epochs with the batch size of 1. Loss function used was Cross-Entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Post Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main post processing steps that were done:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Since the grader gives more importance to Recall of car segmentation, I dilated the result with a 3x3 kernel.\n",
    "2. Resize the image to the original size of 800 x 600 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some example results before and after dilation. Note that these results were taken by running inference on unseen data:\n",

    "![final2](./final1.png)\n",
    "![final3](./final1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Speed Optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Some optimizations were made to increase the inference speed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I used OpenCV (cv2-python) module to encode images instead of PIL (idea by Phu Nguyen (phmagic)).\n",
    "2. OpenCV was used to read data from video too using `cv2.VideoCapture` function.\n",
    "3. [Freeze](http://cv-tricks.com/how-to/freeze-tensorflow-models/) the model and use the frozen model for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to these optimizations, the inference performance was around 6.3, then increased to around 9.5 after I have done the first and second adjustments, and finally improved to 11.4 after the last adjustment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Bloopers and Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "> The date-like numbers below e.g. `2018-05-28-0047` are model identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1. Incorrect brightness setting\n",
    "\n",
    "My initial brightness setting was incorrect. I initially trained with -0.5 to +0.5 brightness which resulted in broken-looking images for negative values:\n",

    "### 6.4. Larger image inputs?\n",
    "\n",
    "I read from the discussion forum that some people claimed larger inputs would improve the model performance, so I tried it. Here is a result with 2 epochs batch size of 1 training with 512x512 pixels:\n",
